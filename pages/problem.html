		<h3>Why is it a problem?</h3>

		<div id = "probtext">
			<p><b>Economic problems</b> are a known stress-trigger <i>(Molitor, 2010)</i>. People facing financial problems might experience anxiety, lack of sleep and empowerment due to worrying about their situation <i>(Lein, 2013)</i>. The amount of stress can harm their mental and physical health over time, and affect their ability to work normally <i>(Vijø, 2015)</i>. This affects both the individual, the people in their personal life and people at their workplace.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
			In 2011, SINTEF estimated that the average extra cost for Norwegian employers when their employees are on sick leave is 13000 NOK per workweek (not including payment to the employee) <i>(Tønset, 2011)</i>. The employer pays the sick employees the first 16 days of leave. This will be a social economy expense, because NAV will refund the cost to the employer.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
			In this context, the first step in avoiding extra social costs related to financial stress is to teach people how they can gain control of their economy. SSB states that economic problems are inheritable. Children who grow up in a family with economic problems, are more likely to experience economic problems later in life, as an adult. <i>(Sæther, 2009)</i>.  We believe that by offering an application that gives people total overview of their income and expenses, we can help people gain control of their economy.<br><br>
